## All About MK
Mindful Kitchen is the brainchild of an idea that I had years ago in my early teens when I realized my family would purchase the same items but would manage to forget the forgotten item in the fridge. I also noticed that it wasnt uncommon to find expired sauces in the fridge because the idea of throwing them away was a sin to my grandparents who moved to the US in the 60's (If you're Carribean or latin then you know the struggle). 

One day I thought what if the fridge could keep track of the contents inside and inform what was running low, if there were duplicates or if there were items that were expiring soon. The idea was to create a device that scanned the barcode of items and track usage. I imagined I'd hire a developer to program the device and the web app, however life has a funny way of happening.  I never imagined in a million years that I would be the one to program the first web app and therefore move forward with the idea that came to me in the middle of my grandparent's kitchen but here we are and here is Mindful Kitchen- What's In Your Fridge?

Mindful Kitchen was created to help users track what's in their fridge and pantry, reduce food waste, and discover sustainable recipes based on ingredients they already have (This is a feature that will be added later on ).
